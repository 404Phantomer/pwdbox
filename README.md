## üîê Security Architecture

- All data is encrypted locally using a key derived from your master password.
- No plaintext passwords or keys are ever stored on disk.
- Security questions are stored as salted Argon2 hashes.
- Exported vault files are encrypted with a user-provided export passphrase.
- Tauri ensures secure sandboxing and native OS integration.

---

## üì§ Export / Import

You can export your full vault into an encrypted `.enc` file and later restore it on another device using the same export password.  
All data remains encrypted end-to-end.
